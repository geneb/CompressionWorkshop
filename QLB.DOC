Because there are now three different versions of Microsoft BASIC that the
Compression Workshop can be used with, it is impractical for us to provide
Quick Libraries for each of them.  Therefore, you must create the CWSHOP.QLB
file yourself.  This is very easy to do, as the following instructions show.

Regardless of which version of BASIC you have, be sure to use the LINK.EXE
that came with your version of BASIC.  Many people have several versions of
LINK.EXE in their path, including the old one that comes with DOS.  If you
are not sure which version of LINK DOS will find you should specify the full
path to your BASIC directory, as shown in the examples below.

QuickBASIC 4.5: \QB\LINK /Q CWSHOP.LIB, CWSHOP.QLB, NUL, BQLB45.LIB ;

BASIC PDS 7.1:  \PDS\LINK /Q CWSHOP7.LIB, CWSHOP.QLB, NUL, QBXQLB.LIB ;

Visual Basic/DOS: \VBDOS\LINK /Q CWSHOP7.LIB, CWSHOP7.QLB, NUL, VBDOSQLB.LIB ;
